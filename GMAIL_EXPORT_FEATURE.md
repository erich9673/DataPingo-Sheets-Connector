# ðŸ“§ Gmail Address Export Feature - IMPLEMENTED

## âœ… **What's New**:

### ðŸŽ¯ **Gmail Address Capture**:
- **OAuth Enhancement**: Modified Google OAuth callbacks to capture user's Gmail address
- **Session Storage**: Store email addresses with authentication tokens
- **Profile API**: Added `getUserProfile()` method to GoogleSheetsService
- **Privacy Logging**: Logs partial email addresses for debugging (e.g., "user***")

### ðŸ“Š **Admin Dashboard Updates**:
- **Display**: Shows actual Gmail addresses instead of just token IDs
- **CSV Export**: Includes Gmail addresses as the first column in exports
- **JSON Export**: Email addresses included in JSON export data
- **Real-time**: Works for all new logins starting immediately

### ðŸ“‹ **CSV Export Format**:
```csv
Gmail Account,Token ID,Login Time,Last Active,Is Authenticated,Has Google Access
"user@gmail.com","abc12345...","2025-07-21T19:45:31.123Z","5 minutes ago","Yes","Yes"
"another@gmail.com","def67890...","2025-07-21T19:40:15.456Z","10 minutes ago","Yes","Yes"
```

## ðŸš€ **How It Works**:

1. **User Logs In** â†’ OAuth flow captures Gmail from Google profile
2. **Session Created** â†’ Email stored with authentication token
3. **Admin Views** â†’ Dashboard shows real Gmail addresses
4. **Export CSV** â†’ Gmail addresses included in first column
5. **Privacy Protected** â†’ Server logs only show partial emails (user***)

## ðŸ”§ **Implementation Details**:

### Backend Changes:
- **`GoogleSheetsService.getUserProfile()`**: New method to get Gmail from Google OAuth2 API
- **`authTokens` Map**: Enhanced to store `email` field with each session
- **OAuth Callbacks**: Both GET and POST callbacks now capture Gmail addresses
- **User Activity Endpoint**: Returns email addresses in session data

### Frontend Changes:
- **Admin Dashboard**: Updated to display Gmail addresses prominently
- **CSV Export**: Modified to include Gmail as first column
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for sessions without email capture

## ðŸŽ¯ **Testing**:

1. **New Login Required**: Existing sessions won't have emails (need fresh login)
2. **Admin Dashboard**: Visit `/admin.html` to see Gmail addresses
3. **CSV Export**: Click "Export CSV" to download file with Gmail addresses
4. **Real-time**: Works immediately for all new authentications

## âš¡ **Backward Compatibility**:
- **Existing Sessions**: Show "No email captured" for old sessions
- **Graceful Degradation**: App works normally even if email capture fails
- **Privacy First**: Emails only visible in admin dashboard and exports

**Deployment**: Railway production (web-production-aafd.up.railway.app)  
**Next**: Users need to log in again to capture their Gmail addresses
