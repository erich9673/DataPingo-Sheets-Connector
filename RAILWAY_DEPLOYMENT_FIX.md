# Railway Deployment Issue - RESOLVED ✅

## Problem
Railway was serving an old version of the DataPingo Sheets Connector app instead of the latest React build with GA4 tracking and recent updates.

## Root Cause
The backend server (server.ts) serves static files from `sheets-connector-backend/public/`, but the React app builds to `sheets-connector-app/dist/`. Railway was serving the old static `index.html` file instead of the built React app.

## Solution
1. **Created deployment script** (`deploy.sh`) that:
   - Builds the React app (`npm run build` in sheets-connector-app)
   - Copies all built files from `sheets-connector-app/dist/` to `sheets-connector-backend/public/`
   - Ensures Railway serves the latest React build

2. **Files copied to backend/public:**
   - `index.html` - Built React app with GA4 tracking
   - `bundle.js` - Compiled React bundle (278KB)
   - All assets (logos, images, TypeScript definitions)

## Verification
✅ Backend now serves built React app with:
- Google Analytics 4 tracking
- Latest authentication fixes
- Updated UI and button text ("Get Started")
- All recent improvements

## Future Deployments
Run `./deploy.sh` from the root directory before committing to ensure Railway serves the latest React build.

## Railway Status
- ✅ Latest commit pushed: `fd67ead`
- ✅ React build copied to backend/public
- ✅ Railway deployment triggered
- ✅ App now serves latest version with GA4 tracking

## Files Updated
- `deploy.sh` - New deployment script
- `sheets-connector-backend/public/index.html` - Now the built React app
- `sheets-connector-backend/public/bundle.js` - React bundle
- All React build assets copied to backend/public
