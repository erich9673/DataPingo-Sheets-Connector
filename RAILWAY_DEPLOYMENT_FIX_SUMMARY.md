# Railway Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue
Railway deployment was failing with:
```
Error: Cannot find module './services/TeamsService'
Require stack:
- /app/sheets-connector-backend/dist/server.js
```

## Root Cause
The `package.json` build script was configured incorrectly:
```json
"build": "echo 'Using pre-compiled JavaScript files'"
```

This meant Railway wasn't actually compiling the TypeScript source files, so the `dist/services/TeamsService.js` file wasn't being generated during deployment.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Build Scripts
```json
// Before
"build": "echo 'Using pre-compiled JavaScript files'",
"build-ts": "echo 'TypeScript build skipped - using pre-compiled files'",

// After  
"build": "tsc",
"build-ts": "tsc",
```

### 2. Moved TypeScript to Production Dependencies
```json
// Moved from devDependencies to dependencies
"typescript": "^5.2.2"
```

This ensures TypeScript is available during Railway's build process.

### 3. Cleaned Up Source Files
- Removed `src/services/DiscordService.ts` (Discord functionality was already removed)
- Ensured only required services are compiled

### 4. Verified Local Build
```bash
npm run clean && npm run build
# Successfully compiles all services:
# - GoogleSheetsService.js
# - MonitoringService.js  
# - SlackService.js
# - TeamsService.js âœ…
```

## Result
- âœ… Local compilation works correctly
- âœ… Server starts successfully with all services
- âœ… Changes committed and pushed to trigger Railway redeploy
- ðŸ”„ Railway should now build and deploy successfully

## Files Modified
- `sheets-connector-backend/package.json` - Fixed build scripts and dependencies
- Removed `sheets-connector-backend/src/services/DiscordService.ts`

## Expected Outcome
Railway deployment should now:
1. Install TypeScript as a production dependency
2. Run `tsc` to compile TypeScript source files
3. Generate all required `.js` files in the `dist` directory
4. Successfully start the server with all services available
