Hey [Name]!

I just finished building a Slack app that monitors Google Sheets and sends real-time notifications - perfect for tracking sales, inventory, or any important spreadsheet data.

Could you help me reach the 10 installations needed for Slack App Store submission? It takes 2 minutes to install and you can remove it anytime.

💡 What it does: Connects your Google Sheets to Slack for instant notifications when data changes

Thanks for supporting my project! 🚀
